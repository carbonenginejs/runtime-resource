CarbonEngineJS resource lifecycle, cache, format selection, source, and object
loading contracts — the GPU-free resource layer.

Use this package when you need Carbon-shaped resource loading (`res:/` paths,
requirement/emit selection, `Ready()`/`GetObject()`), canonical GPU-free shader
reflection, or one of the bundled format readers without choosing a GPU
backend. It sits between format/resource providers and the engines that
realize prepared resources. It owns neither WebGL/WebGPU realization nor the
standalone shader parser/compiler packages.

## Install

```sh
npm install @carbonenginejs/runtime-resource
```

## Quick start

Concrete formats are explicit tree-shakeable subpaths, never imported by the
package root:

```js
import {
  CjsResMan,
  CjsResManFetchProvider
} from "@carbonenginejs/runtime-resource";
import { CjsMp4Format } from "@carbonenginejs/runtime-resource/formats/mp4";

const resMan = new CjsResMan().Register({
  paths: {
    res: "https://cdn.example.invalid/resources/"
  },
  source: new CjsResManFetchProvider(),
  formats: [ CjsMp4Format ]
});

const resource = resMan.GetResource("res:/video/intro.mp4");
const video = await resource.Ready();
```

Extensions can also choose the resource/object handler and an ordered reader
route explicitly. This is useful for Carbon object streams, where either file
suffix may contain Black bytes or Red/YAML text:

```js
import { CjsLoadingObject } from "@carbonenginejs/runtime-resource";
import { CjsBlackFormat } from "@carbonenginejs/runtime-resource/formats/black";
import { CjsRedFormat } from "@carbonenginejs/runtime-resource/formats/red";

resMan.RegisterExtension("red", CjsLoadingObject, [
  CjsBlackFormat,
  CjsRedFormat
]);
resMan.RegisterExtension("black", CjsLoadingObject, [
  CjsBlackFormat,
  CjsRedFormat
]);

const object = await resMan.Fetch("res:/definition/example.red");
```

Browser consumers use worker-backed fetch and declared worker-safe format
readers by default, with deterministic main-thread fallback; see
[browser worker execution](docs/reference/workers.md).

Raw audio resource ownership is available from an explicit subpath:

```js
import {
  CjsAudioBufferRes,
  CjsAudioRes
} from "@carbonenginejs/runtime-resource/resource/audio";
```

`CjsAudioRes` always represents one addressable audio file. Its backing may be
a complete loose file, an individually served response, or a window within a
shared `CjsAudioBufferRes` bank payload.

Canonical effect-resource and shader reflection classes are available from:

```js
import {
  Tr2EffectRes,
  Tr2Shader
} from "@carbonenginejs/runtime-resource/resource/shader";
```

`Tr2EffectRes` fail-closed validates complete permutation topology and portable
reflection, selects a package permutation, and hydrates it into a cached,
device-free `Tr2Shader`. Engines add programs, layouts, bindings, and other GPU
state.

## Development

Non-interactive baseline checks run from the repository root:

```sh
npm install
npm run lint
npm run check
npm test
```

`npm run check` builds the consumer package and proves that decorator metadata
matches between authoring source and built output. `npm test` additionally
runs the complete GPU-free unit suite; it requires no private assets,
credentials, network access, browser, or GPU after dependencies are installed.
