Status: Evolving  
Scope: `@carbonenginejs/runtime-resource`  
Audience: Users and integrators  
Summary: Documentation home for the GPU-free resource lifecycle, cache, format, and object-loading package.

## Purpose

`@carbonenginejs/runtime-resource` owns the GPU-free resource layer of
CarbonEngineJS: resource identity and state, the MotherLode cache, semantic
resource classes, registered format readers, fetch providers, and the queued
CPU load/publication pipeline. It stops at a published CPU payload; engine
packages realize that payload into backend objects. It also owns the canonical
device-free `Tr2EffectRes`/`Tr2Shader` reflection graph, built by reading the
compiled Carbon container directly.

## Use this package when

- you need Carbon-shaped resource loading (`res:/` paths, requirement/emit
  selection, `Ready()`/`GetObject()`) without choosing a GPU backend;
- you need one of the non-shader format readers as a tree-shakeable subpath
  (`@carbonenginejs/runtime-resource/formats/<name>`);
- you need canonical effect permutation selection or immutable shader
  reflection records from `@carbonenginejs/runtime-resource/resource/shader`;
- you need canonical raw audio resources for complete files or byte windows
  over shared physical sources;
- you are writing an engine adapter that consumes published CPU payloads and
  needs the documented retention, reload, and texture-array contracts.

## Where it fits

- Foundations consumed: `@carbonenginejs/runtime-utils` (event emitter, model
  contracts) and `@carbonenginejs/runtime-utils` where formats need math values.
- Normal consumers: `runtime-core` (configures and exposes a `CjsResMan`),
  `runtime-trinity` and `runtime-sof` (request GPU-free objects), and engine
  packages (`engine-webgpu`, future WebGL engines) that realize prepared
  resources.
- Owned responsibility: resource identity, cache, CPU payload lifecycle,
  format selection and conversion, load/publication queues, and canonical
  device-free effect/shader reflection hydration and selection.
- Owned elsewhere: WebGL/WebGPU realization, device budgets, and device-loss
  recovery belong to engine packages; shader formats belong to the dedicated
  shader format packages.
